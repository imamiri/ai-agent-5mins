# Build an AI Agent in 5mins
This project implements a custom AI agent that can answer questions by following a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, and Response. The agent is designed to retrieve specific information, such as the capital city of a country or the population of a city, and provide a final answer based on the gathered data.

## Features
    - Thought-Action-Response Loop: The agent follows a structured process to answer questions:
        - Thought: The agent thinks about how to answer the question.
        - Action: The agent performs an action to retrieve information (e.g., looking up a capital city or population).
        - PAUSE: The agent pauses after performing the action.
        - Response: The agent responds with the result of the action.

    - Available Actions:
        - lookup_capital: Finds the capital city of a given country.
        - find_population: Looks up the population of a given city or country.

## How to Run
    - Install the required dependencies.
    - Set up your OpenAI API key.
    - Run the script and interact with the agent via the CLI.
